### DETAILS

Spage is a locally hosted web application with a single text box "prompt bar" in the middle of the screen.  
The idea of the project is that you can type various commands such as:
- "Change the background to a blurple color"
- "Write a creative message in the top left of the screen"
- "Spawn an image of a calico cat below the prompt bar"
- "Change this message to have a different font and color"

The website retains conversation history (within the active session), so follow up commands also work:
- "Don't like it, change it back"
- "You made it too large, decrease the size"

As of (01/26) the following elements are able to be generated and edited on SPAGE:
- Background color
- Text
- (stock) Images (search/import via URL)

This project employs a REACT+TypeScript Frontend along with a Python Backend.  
Along with commonly used libraries, the following libraries are used:
- Google Gemini API for prompt processing
- Unsplash API for image search
